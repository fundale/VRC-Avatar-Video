1. Drag "VideoBroadcast" into world hierarchy.

2. Set "Assets/USharpVideo/Materials/VideoScreen" (USharpVideo's VideoScreen) into "Assets/Video Avatar/World/Video Stream" both material slots.

3. Enable "Shared Material" at the bottom on "USharpVideo/VideoScreen" in the hierarchy.

4. Set "Assets/Avatar Video/Avatar Video" as the texture for your selected shader, or select "Assets/Avatar Video/Avatar/Avatar Material" as your material.
